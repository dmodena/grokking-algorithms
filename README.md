Grokking Algorithms
---

This repository was inspired by the book **"Grokking Algorithms: An Illustrated Guide for Programmers and Other Curious People"** by **Aditya Bhargava** *(in Portuguese, "Entendendo Algoritmos: Um Guia Ilustrado Para Programadores e Outros Curiosos")*.

The repository contains implementation of some of the algorithms mentioned in the book, along with other algorithms. The code in this project is not intended to demonstrate the *best* or *correct* way to implement the algorithms. This is being publised as reference only.
